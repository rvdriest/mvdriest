### The challenge

I made the video for a KON Films contest. A short commercial had to be made for the ZRK London brand. I tried to give the video a vintage look, but the clothes had to be clearly visible and it was allowed to last a maximum of 30 seconds.

### The result

I made the video with Adobe Premier Pro and after a lot of research and through reference films I came up with the idea of ​​the film. The video is quickly clear and has the right look. The 3 aspects make the video complete.
