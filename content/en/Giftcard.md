### The challenge

Commissioned by Het Bureau, I was commissioned to make a gift card for Het Bureau. I tried to make it look like a gift in the corporate identity of Het Bureau.

### The result

I personally think it turned out well, because it is in the style of Het Bureau and it looks nice and fresh. It is also immediately clear through the lines that it is a gift card. It also shows at the top right how much percent discount you have and all that in one glance.
